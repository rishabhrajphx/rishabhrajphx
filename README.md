- üëã Howdy y'all! I'm Rishabh Raj, a driven Junior at Arizona State University's Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering, diving deep into the world of Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering set to graduate in the summer of 2026.

- From tinkering with my dad's old computer as a kid to building intricate projects today, code has always been my way of turning ideas into reality. My passion lies in crafting innovative and efficient software solutions (that are also pretty to look at), and I'm constantly soaking up knowledge and skills to elevate my craft.

- Beyond the technical side, I value teamwork, open communication, and a good dose of creativity. When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring the vibrant ASU campus, helping out the Alumni Association, hiking under the Arizona sun, or trying out the latest tech gadgets. ‚òÄÔ∏è
